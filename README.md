# OTP generator library

An easy to use library for generating OTP for your apps.

[![JitPack](https://jitpack.io/v/Abhay-cloud/OTP-Generator.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Abhay-cloud/OTP-Generator)


## Implementation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file.

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```bash 
 allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```bash
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.Abhay-cloud:OTP-Generator:0.0.1'
	}
```
    

## Usage
```java
int createOTP= otp.generateOTP();
```

You are free to contribute here. This is first version. I'll add more awesome updates in near future.
